# Web Programming Project Proposal
As a team, we have collaboratively explored the potential projects for this year and have settled on developing a Grocery Price Tracker. We anticipate that this project will not only bring forth some interesting challenges that will enhance our programming skills, but that it will also serve as a platform to showcase our collective development skills, teamwork, and problem-solving capabilities.

Our end goal is to create a website that prioritizes user-friendliness and reliability. The website's interface will feature a seamlessly designed homepage, ensuring that first-time users can effortlessly understand how to navigate through our platform. All users will have the ability to search, categorize, or browse real-time pricing trends of various products across multiple stores.

Furthermore, registered users will enjoy additional interactive features, including the ability to engage with others by commenting or reviewing products, accessing specific product details, and setting personalized product alerts. They will also have the convenience of saving their favorite items and preferred grocery stores, with all this information being securely stored in their user accounts.

Administrators will have access to the removal of inappropriate comments and will be able to block these users from future commenting when necessary. Additionally, administrators will have the capability to manage the product database, and view isights into recent site trends.

Our vision for the Grocery Price Tracker is not only to provide valuable real-time pricing information but also to create a dynamic and engaging platform that saves users time when it comes to finding the cheapest groceries.
